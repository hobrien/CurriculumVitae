# Heath O'Brien Curriculum Vitae

This contains the code to build my [cv](https://hobrien.github.io/cv/obrien_cv.pdf). It was built in Rmarkdown using the [Twenty Seconds](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex) CV Template and the [vitae](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/index.html) package.

- This requires [version 4 of FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) to be available as a system font. On a mac, this requires downloading the font, then double-clicking on `FontAwesome.otf`
